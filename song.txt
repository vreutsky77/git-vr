Ay, Jim, you know the ol' sugar daddies?
They be trickin', they tell them girls
I said you could have whatever you like (if you like)
I said you could have whatever you like (if you like)
Yeah (yeah)
Stacks on deck (deck)
Patron on ice (ice)
And we can pop bottles all night
And, baby, you could have whatever you like (if you like)
I said you could have whatever you like (if you like), yeah (yeah)
Late night sex, so wet and so tight (tight)
I gas up the jet for you tonight
And, baby, you could go wherever you like (if you like)
I said you could go wherever you like (if you like), yeah (yeah)

Anytime you want to pick up the telephone, you
Know it ain't nothin' to drop a couple stacks on you
Want it, you could get it, my dear
Five million dollar home, dropâ€¦
